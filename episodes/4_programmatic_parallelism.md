Parallel programming has been important to (scientific) computing for decades as a way to decrease how long a piece of
code takes to run making more complex computations possible, such as in climate modelling, pharmaceutical development,
aircraft design, AI and machine learning, and etc. Without parallelisation, these computations which would take years to
finish can instead be completed in hours or days! In this episode, we will cover the foundational concepts of parallel
programming. But, before we get into the nitty-gritty details of parallelisation frameworks and techniques, let's first
familiarise ourselves with the key ideas behind parallel programming.

## What is parallelisation?

At some point you, or someone you know, has probably asked "how can I make my code faster?" The answer to this question
will depend on the code, but there are a few approaches you might try:

- Optimise the code.
- Move the computationally demanding parts of the code from a slower, interpreted language, such as Python, to a faster,
  compiled language such as C, C++ or Fortran.
- Use a different theoretical/computational or approximate method which requires less computation.

All of these reduce the total amount of work the processor does. Parallelisation takes a different approach: splitting
the workload across multiple processing units such as central processing units (**CPU**s) or graphics processing units
(**GPU**s). Each processing unit works on a smaller batch of work simultaneously. Instead of reducing the amount of
work to be done by, e.g. optimising our code, we instead have multiple processors working on the task at the same time.

### Sequential vs. parallel computing

Traditionally, computers execute one instruction at a time, in the sequence defined by the code you have written. In
other words, your code is compiled into a series of instructions which are executed one after another. We call this
serial execution.

With parallel computing, multiple instructions, from the same program, are carried out at the same time on different
processing units. This means more work is being done at once, so we get the results quicker than if we were running the
same set of instructions sequentially on a single processor. The process of changing sequential code to parallel code is
called parallelisation.

## Painting a room

Parallel computing means dividing a job into tasks that can run at the same time. Imagine painting four walls in a room.
The problem is painting the room. The tasks are painting each wall. The tasks are independent, you don't need to finish
one wall before starting another.

If there is only one painter, they must work on one wall at a time. With one painter, painting the walls is
*sequential*, because they paint one wall at the time. But since each wall is independent, the painter can switch
between painting them in any order. This is *concurrent* work, where they are making progress on multiple walls over
time, but not simultaneously.

With two or more painters, walls can be painted at the same time. This is *parallel* work, because the painters are
making painting the room by painting multiple walls at the same time.

In this analogy, the painters represent CPU cores. The number of cores limits how many tasks can run in parallel. Even
if there are many tasks, only as many can progress simultaneously as there are cores. Managing many tasks with fewer
cores is called concurrency.

## Key parallelisation concepts

There is, unfortunately, more to parallelisation than simply dividing work across multiple processors. Whilst the idea
of splitting tasks to achieve faster results is *conceptually* simple, the practical implementation is more complex.
Adding additional CPU cores raises new issues:

- If there are two cores, they might share the same RAM (shared memory) or each have their own dedicated RAM (private
  memory). This distinction affects how data can be accessed and shared between processors.
- In a shared memory setup, what happens if two cores try to read or write the same memory location at the same time?
  This can cause a race condition, where the outcome depends on the timing of operations.
- How do we divide and distribute the workload evenly among the CPU cores? Dividing the workload unevenly will result in
  inefficient parallelisation.
- How will the cores exchange data and coordinate their actions? Additional mechanisms are required to enable this.
- After the tasks are complete, where should the final results be stored? Should they remain in the memory of one CPU
  core, be copied to a shared memory area, or written to disk? Additionally, which core handles producing the output?

To answer these questions, we need to understand what a **process** and what a **thread** is, how they are different,
and how they interact with the computer's resources (memory, file system, etc.).

## Processes

A process is an individual running instance of a software program. Each process operates independently and possesses its
own set of resources, such as memory space and open files, managed by the operating system. Because of this separation,
data in one processes is typically isolated and cannot be directly accessed by another process.

passing over a network.](fig/multiprocess.svg)

One approach to achieve parallel execution is by running multiple coordinated processes at the same time. But what if
one processes needs information from another processes? Since processes are isolated and have private memory spaces,
information has to be explicitly communicated by the programmer between processes. This is the role of parallel
programming frameworks and libraries such as MPI (Message Passing Interface). MPI provides a standardised library of
functions that allow processes to exchange messages, coordinate tasks and collectively work on a problem together.

This style of parallelisation is the dominant form of parallelisation on HPC systems. By combining MPI with a cluster's
job scheduler, it is possible to launch and coordinate processes across many compute nodes. Instead of having access to
just a single CPU or computer, our code can now use thousands or even tens of thousands of CPUs across many computers
which are connected together.

## Threads

A thread is a unit of execution which exists within a process. Unlike processes, threads share their parent process'
resources, including memory and open files, so they can directly read and write the same memory space. This shared
access means threads can exchange data faster, since they do not have to communicate it between them.

![Multiple threads within a single process, sharing the same memory space and resources.](fig/multithreading.svg)

By running multiple threads, over multiple CPU cores, a program can coordinate for each thread to work on their own
task(s). For example, one thread may handle input/output whilst other threads perform some number crunching, or multiple
threads might process different parts of a dataset simultaneously.

A major advantage of using threads is their relative ease of use compared to processes. With frameworks such as OpenMP,
existing code can often be adapted for parallel execution with relatively small changes. Because threads share a memory
space, there is no need for explicit message-passing mechanisms (as required with processes). However, this shared
memory model introduces the possibility of race conditions, where two or more threads attempt to update the same data at
once. Careful synchronisation is therefore required. It is important to note, however, that threads are confined to a
single process and therefore to a single computer. Programs which are parallelised using threads cannot span across
compute nodes in a cluster.

## Shared vs distributed memory parallelisation

When writing parallel programs, a key distinction is whether there is a single shared memory space or if there are
multiple private memory spaces. These two models are called shared memory and distributed memory.

![Comparison of shared and distributed memory architectures: shared memory shows multiple processors accessing one
memory pool, while distributed memory shows processors each with private memory connected by communication
links.](fig/memory-pattern.png)

In a shared memory system, all processors (or cores) can directly access and modify the same pool of memory. Changes
made by one processor are immediately visible to the others. This model aligns naturally with parallelisation using
**threads**, which exist within a single process and share the parent processâ€™ memory. However, shared memory has
limitations: if multiple threads try to update the same data simultaneously, race conditions can occur. Correct results
require careful synchronisation. Programming models such as OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing) provide mechanisms to divide
work among threads and synchronise access to shared data. In general, shared memory approaches are generally limited to
the cores within a single computer or node. The advantage of shared memory is its simplicity, making it easier to
implement and debug. The main disadvantage is limited scalability, as performance gains are constrained by the number of
cores in a single node and the complexity of synchronisation.

In a distributed memory system, each processor has its own private memory. Data cannot be accessed directly by other
processors, it must be explicitly sent and received. This model aligns with parallelisation using **processes** which
each have their own private memory space. Communication between processes is typically handled using libraries such as
MPI. Distributed memory programming requires more effort than shared memory, but it enables programs to scale across
multiple nodes in a cluster. The advantage of distributed memory is its high scalability, allowing computations across
thousands of nodes. The disadvantages include increased programming complexity and additional overheads required for
communication information, as data must be explicitly exchanged between processes (private memory spaces).

The differences can be summarised:

- Accessibility: Shared memory allows direct access to a common memory space. Distributed memory requires explicit
  communication for data exchange.
- Memory scope: Shared memory provides a global pool, while distributed memory isolates each processorâ€™s memory.
- Consistency: In shared memory, changes are immediately visible to all cores. In distributed memory, explicit
  synchronisation is needed to keep results consistent.
- Scalability: Shared memory is limited to one node. Distributed memory scales to thousands of nodes.
- Programming complexity: Shared memory models are simpler to use but harder to scale. Distributed memory models scale
  well but require more explicit programming.
- Advantages/Disadvantages: Shared memory is easier to program , but is limited in scale and prone to synchronisation
  issues. Distributed memory scales to more cores, but is more complex and requires explicit data communication.

In sophisticated applications, a hybrid approach is used which combines using processes to spread the workload across
multiple nodes, but uses shared-memory parallelisation on a node. This takes advantage of the scalability of distributed
memory, and the efficiency of using shared-memory with threads.

## Synchronisation and race conditions

Synchronisation ensures that processing units can coordinate their actions correctly, particularly when threads are
accessing or modifying shared data. Without proper synchronisation, multiple threads, for example, might attempt to
update the same variable simultaneously, leading to unpredictable results known as a race condition.

In a shared memory system, synchronisation mechanisms such as barriers, locks, and atomic operations are used to control
access to shared data and to coordinate work. A barrier ensures that threads have reached a certain point before
continuing, while locks prevent sections of code from being executed simultaneously, preventing race conditions. Atomic
operations allow individual updates to shared variables without interference, meaning only one thread can update a
variable at once. Proper use of these mechanisms ensures code correctness, maintaining consistent and valid results.

In distributed memory systems, synchronisation is achieved by coordinating communication between processes to order the
workload and manage data dependencies. Even though processes have their own private memory space, race conditions can
still occur if two processes write to the same file. Effective synchronisation, whether with threads or processes, is
crucial for ensuring that parallel programs produce correct, reproducible results.

## Organising the painters

Imagine several painters working on the same set of walls. If each painter tries to paint the same wall at the same time
without coordinating, they might overwrite each otherâ€™s work creating a mess. This is like a race condition in parallel
programming, where there is simultaneous memory access modifying the same data.

To avoid this, painters might take turns for the shared wall, or divide walls so each painter works independently. In
programming, mechanisms like barriers or atomic operations perform the same role: they synchronise access to shared
resources.

This coordination ensures that all parts of the task progress in the right order, whether you are updating a shared
variable, writing results to disk, or aggregating data.
